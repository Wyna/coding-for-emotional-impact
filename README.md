Coding For Emotional Impact
===========================
## Syllabus (Work in Progress)
###Week 1: Seeing, Hearing, Feeling
- What is narrative arc? What is composition? What are its basic building blocks?
- What does it mean to compose narrative arc computationally?
- What is a pattern? When does a pattern cease to be a pattern?
- Can patterns be emotional?

##### HW 1: Collect 100 examples of compelling pattern-driven compositions. Pick 10 to talk about in class the following week.

### Weeks 2, 3: Generate Feeling
- Drumming Exercise
- Math Review: What is a wave function anyway?
- Repeating patterns using arithmetic and simple periodic wave functions.
- Modulating wave functions with frequency and amplitude.
- Recursive wave functions.

##### HW 2: Assign an arbitrary emotion to each student. Create 3 computational interpretations of your emotion by simply animating a rectangle on the screen with a wave function.
##### HW 3: Apply it to your medium of choice. 

### Weeks 4, 5: Playing with Timing and Pacing
- Embodying pacing: Walking down Broadway.
- Extending attention span.
- Building tension.
- Playing with the rate of change.
- When does change become perceptible?
- Linear versus geometric growth.
- Introduce the Story Grapher.

##### HW 4: Take your homework from Week 3 and use the Story Grapher to generate 10 more interpretations, this time try to interpret at least 3 distinct emotions. 
##### HW 5: Apply to your medium of choice.

### Week 6: Disruption
- How do you establish a pattern?
- Once you've established it, how do you break it?
- What is monotony? What is surprise?
- Defining ratios and proportions with linear and non-linear scaling.
- Judicious use of random() and noise().

##### HW 6: Apply to your medium of choice of choice.

### Week 7: Unpredictability
- Layering techniques for generating "unpredictable" patterns.
- Using probability to generate "unpredictable" patterns.

##### HW 7: Apply to your medium of choice.

### Week 8: Momentous Occasions and Catastrophic Events
- Establishing landmark events.
- Building up to a grand finale.
- Orchestrating a disaster.
- Defining conditions to set thresholds.

##### HW 8: Apply to your medium of choice.

### Week 9,10: Putting it all together
- A polyphonic model for composing narrative and emotional arc.

##### HW 9: Design 3 models for your final project proposal.
##### HW 10: Pick 1 of your designs and flesh it out.

### Week 11: Small group presentations / discussions of final project.

### Week 12: Final project presentations

## Class Description
We live in an era of unprecedented technological innovation with ingenious new advances for achieving clean energy, eradicating disease and providing greater wellness, more equitably and effectively delivering education, and improving the quality of human existence and expression. At the same time, we are experiencing clear deficits within centralized institutions of government and civil society: deficits of agility, innovation and capacity.

These traditional institutions are failing to tap into the diversity of expertise and experience of individuals and communities, rendering us less able to quickly discover, recognize, implement and scale innovative approaches to pressing problems and making it impossible to translate technological innovation into social progress.

Our current system of centralized government institutions is designed for an earlier age of limited, one-way communication. Consider:

Our 18th century model of voting for representatives doesn’t maximize the flow of personal or community preferences from people to government.

Our19th century addition of professional bureaucracy doesn't maximize the flow of expertise, widely distributed in society.
Put another way, we can’t make the best decisions in government on how to improve people’s lives if we limit public participation and feedback to voting every few years. And we can’t adequately take advantage of people’s talents, abilities and desire to play a role in governing if we relegate their service to civic engagement disconnected from the real power, money and decision-making.

Governments appropriate plenty for innovation in society. They fund research grants; invest in broadband infrastructure; support science education. But they spend next to nothing on reinventing government institutions by informing and empowering citizen to participate. There is no other industry, and not one as big as the public sector, that doesn’t regularly improve on its core business model.

New technology has the potential to transform governance and produce a more open and participatory political culture with effective institutions that engender trust.

New technology makes collaborative problem solving possible. In this course, we explore how we might use technology -- from big data to social media -- to redesign our systems of governance to devolve power from centralized, hierarchical institutions and evolve more robust collaboration among individuals, groups and institutions including government and the media.

Through blogging assignments, discussions and a final design project, participants will apply what we learn about innovation to the issues about which they are the most passionate.
