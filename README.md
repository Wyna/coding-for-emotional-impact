Coding For Emotional Impact
===========================
## Syllabus (Work in Progress)
###Week 1: Seeing, Hearing, Feeling
- What is narrative arc? What is composition? What are its basic building blocks?
- What does it mean to compose narrative arc computationally?
- What is a pattern? When does a pattern cease to be a pattern?
- Can patterns be emotional?

##### HW 1: Collect 100 examples of compelling pattern-driven compositions. Pick 10 to talk about in class the following week.

### Weeks 2, 3: Generate Feeling
- Drumming Exercise
- Math Review: What is a wave function anyway?
- Repeating patterns using arithmetic and simple periodic wave functions.
- Modulating wave functions with frequency and amplitude.
- Recursive wave functions.

##### HW 2: Assign an arbitrary emotion to each student. Create 3 computational interpretations of your emotion by simply animating a rectangle on the screen with a wave function.
##### HW 3: Apply it to your medium of choice. 

### Weeks 4, 5: Playing with Timing and Pacing
- Embodying pacing: Walking down Broadway.
- Extending attention span.
- Building tension.
- Playing with the rate of change.
- When does change become perceptible?
- Linear versus geometric growth.
- Introduce the Story Grapher.

##### HW 4: Take your homework from Week 3 and use the Story Grapher to generate 10 more interpretations, this time try to interpret at least 3 distinct emotions. 
##### HW 5: Apply to your medium of choice.

### Week 6: Disruption
- How do you establish a pattern?
- Once you've established it, how do you break it?
- What is monotony? What is surprise?
- Defining ratios and proportions with linear and non-linear scaling.
- Judicious use of random() and noise().

##### HW 6: Apply to your medium of choice of choice.

### Week 7: Unpredictability
- Layering techniques for generating "unpredictable" patterns.
- Using probability to generate "unpredictable" patterns.

##### HW 7: Apply to your medium of choice.

### Week 8: Momentous Occasions and Catastrophic Events
- Establishing landmark events.
- Building up to a grand finale.
- Orchestrating a disaster.
- Defining conditions to set thresholds.

##### HW 8: Apply to your medium of choice.

### Week 9,10: Putting it all together
- A polyphonic model for composing narrative and emotional arc.

##### HW 9: Design 3 models for your final project proposal.
##### HW 10: Pick 1 of your designs and flesh it out.

### Week 11: Small group presentations / discussions of final project.

### Week 12: Final project presentations

## Class Description
Coming out of nowhere. Monotonous drone. Running out of steam. Pregnant pause. Unbearable build up in tension. Gratifying resolution. We use these phrases all the time to describe music and film, animation and dialogue. We strive to provoke these reactions when we compose a piece of music or author a story.

What are we actually talking about? Narrative arc and its more abstract cousin, composition.

Anything that plays out over time inevitably also plays out over a narrative and emotional arc, part of which is intrinsic to the events that are happening, part of which is constructed in the mind of the viewer.

But what does it mean to compose for animation, music and stories in terms of rules and patterns expressed in code? Why attempt to compose at all in code? There's no reason to other than because your work is interactive or you want it to be able to run forever. In both cases, you can't predefine how your composition plays out over time yet at the same time you don't want to give up complete control over how it unfolds.

In this class, we will look at how to use simple computational strategies for composing patterns of events that are capable of producing emotional impact. 

The class is agnostic to medium. "Narrative events" can be shifts in color in an animated painting, shifts in meter in a piece of generative music or shifts in the emotional state of the protagonist of your interactive story. You define the events. The class provides you with techniques for shaping those events in dynamic ways over time.

The course is also as much an exercise in cultivating personal sensitivity to the emotional power of patterns as it is a class in how to write code to generate such patterns. We will devote as much time to collecting and dissecting compelling examples of narrative composition as we do to writing code because it is only through spending a lot of time with analog examples that we can hope to extract the rules we need to approximate them in digital form.

Assignments will alternate between programming exercises done in Processing and more creative assignments applying newly learned techniques to the medium of your choice, in the programming language of your choice. Since this is as much a course about perception as it is about code, user testing your creations will be as important as the creations themselves!
